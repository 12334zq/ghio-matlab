Guided hybrid input-and-output (GHIO), HIO and shrink-wrap Matlab functions

# Introduction 

This Matlab function set consists of some useful functions for phase retrival and image reconstruction that widely used in the community of X-ray coherent diffraction imaging (XCDI). 

# Function usage

## hio2d.m

Developed by Fienup [1], well known and widely used algorithm for XCDI resarch.Supports oversampling smoothness develped by Miao's group [2].

## ghio.m
Developed by Chien-Chun Chen *et al*. when he was in Institute of Physics in Academia Sinica [3].

## shrinkwrap.m

Developed by S. Marchesini *et al*. [4].
